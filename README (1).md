# GESTURE-RECOGNITION

# HAND GESTURE CONTROL SYSTEM
The Hand Gesture Control System is an innovative project that utilizes computer vision techniques to control a computer using hand gestures.It is a Python application designed to provide users with a hands-free control interface for their computer. By utilizing a webcam, the app detects hand gestures in real-time and translates them into various actions, such as mouse clicks, copying, selecting, scrolling, and adjusting volume. This project aims to offer an intuitive and accessible way for users to interact with their devices, particularly beneficial for individuals with limited mobility or those seeking an alternative input method.

# Technologies Used
# MediaPipe
A machine learning framework developed by Google that provides pre-built solutions for various computer vision tasks, including hand tracking.

# OpenCV
An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, providing various functions for real-time computer vision like image and video processing, including feature detection and object tracking.

# PyAutoGUI
A Python library that enables cross-platform automation of mouse and keyboard inputs, making it ideal for simulating user interactions in the Hand Gesture Control System.

# Tinkter
A cross-platform widget toolkit that provides a library of basic elements of GUI widgets for building a graphical user interface (GUI) in many programming languages

# Python Imaging Library 
PIL is a popular library for image processing in Python. It is used by a variety of applications, including web applications, desktop applications, and machine learning algorithms.

# Project Overview
1. The Hand Gesture Control System captures live video feed from a webcam.
2. It uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand gestures in real-time.
3. OpenCV is employed for image processing tasks such as resizing, color conversion, and drawing overlays.
4. PyAutoGUI is utilized to simulate mouse movements and clicks based on detected hand gestures.
